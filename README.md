# Azure Scans

Azure Scans is a Manga Reading web app where a user can read many mangas and also Manhwas(korean Comics),Manhuas(Chinese Comics), i am making this web app because i like to read manga
all the time and it is like my hobby i look forward to making this web app

these are the current goals for this project

->making robust user authentication pages (login and signup with proper database)
->making main page where all the latest updated manga are shown
->making genre wise page where user cna click on the genre and related manga shows up
->making a trending page where trending mangas are shown
->make it so user can bookmark and save their manga and also review them 




these are some of the featues that i want to make after successfully making a basuc manga app
-> comment section in every chapter and main page of the manga
-> following each other on this web app and make friends and these friends can also see which manga their friend reads and what are their favourites  (this one is also complex)
-> using an AI for translation in the language which the manga is not available in but the demand is high (this one is gonna be ultra complex)
